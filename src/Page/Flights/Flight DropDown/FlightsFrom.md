# FlightsFrom Component Details

## Symbols

- `airport`: State variable to store the user input for airport search.
- `airportDetail`: State variable to store the fetched airport details.
- `liData`: State variable to manage the state of ListItemButton.
- `setAriportFrom`: Function from `useAuth` context to set the selected airport details.

## State Variables

- `airport`: String state variable initialized to store the user input for airport search.
- `airportDetail`: Array state variable initialized to store the fetched airport details.
- `liData`: Boolean state variable initialized to manage the state of ListItemButton.
- `setAriportFrom`: Function from `useAuth` context to set the selected airport details.

## Functionality

- `handleChange`: Handles input change in the airport search input field (`onChange` event).
- `fetchData`: Fetches airport details from the API based on the user input (`useEffect` with dependency on `airport`).
- `handleLiData`: Sets the selected airport details using `setAriportFrom` and closes the component modal (`onclose` function).

## Connections with Other Components

- **Context**: Uses `useAuth` context to set the selected airport details (`setAriportFrom`).
- **ListItemButton**: Utilizes `ListItemButton` component from `@mui/material` to display airport details and handle selection.

## Output

- Renders a modal component (`div` with specific styling and input field for airport search).
- Displays a list of airports fetched from the API in `ul` with `ListItemButton` for each airport showing city, name, and country details.
- Allows selection of an airport which triggers `handleLiData` to set the selected airport details and close the modal.
