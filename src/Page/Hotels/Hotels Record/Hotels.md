# Hotel.js
The Hotels component you've provided is quite extensive and handles various functionalities related to hotel search, filtering, date selection, and more. Here's a summary of what the component does and some recommendations:

# Summary of Functionality:
## State Management:

Manages state variables using useState for page number, fetching status, initial API call flag, hotel data, error handling, sorting options, selected values, and more.

## Context Usage:

Utilizes useAuth context hook to manage hotel location, departure date, search results, and seat counts.

## Date Picker Integration:

Uses react-datepicker for selecting check-in and check-out dates with custom input components (CustomInput and CustomInputCheckout).

## Dropdown Handling:

Implements a dropdown for location selection with filtering based on user input and shows filtered results.

## Infinite Scroll:

Implements infinite scroll functionality for fetching more hotel data as the user scrolls down the page.

## API Integration:

Fetches hotel data from an API based on location, date, filters (like price and rating), and paginated results.

## Filtering and Sorting:

Provides checkboxes for filtering hotels by price range and user rating. Updates the results dynamically based on selected filters.

## Traveller Details:

Allows toggling of traveller details panel to select the number of adults and children staying in the hotel.
UI and Components:

Uses custom CSS classes (Hotels.module.css) for styling components and ensuring responsive design.

# Recommendations:
## Error Handling:

Ensure robust error handling throughout the component to manage API failures, input errors, and edge cases.
## Optimization:

Consider optimizing API calls and rendering, especially with large datasets or frequent updates.

## Accessibility and UX:

Ensure accessibility features like ARIA attributes, focus management, and keyboard navigation for improved user experience.

## Testing:

Test thoroughly, especially edge cases such as empty search results, API timeouts, or unexpected data formats.

## code Organization:

Organize code further into smaller, manageable functions or components where possible to improve readability and maintainability.

## Documentation:

Document complex logic, API integrations, and important functions within the codebase for future reference.
