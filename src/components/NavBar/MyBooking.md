# MyBooking Component Explanation

## Overview
This Markdown file provides an explanation of the MyBooking component in the application.

## Purpose
The MyBooking component is responsible for displaying user bookings fetched from an API endpoint. It handles conditional rendering based on the user's login status and provides a user-friendly interface to view booking details.

## Dependencies

### React
Utilizes React framework for building UI components.

### Navbar Component
Imports and renders the Navbar component for navigation and UI consistency.

### Context
Uses the useAuth hook from the context to manage authentication status (isLoggedIn) and retrieve authentication token (bartoken) from local storage.

## State Management
- `bookingData`: State variable to store booking details fetched from the API.
- `bartoken`: Retrieves the authentication token (token) from local storage.

## Effect Hook (`useEffect`)

### Fetching Data
Uses useEffect to fetch booking data from the API endpoint (https://academics.newtonschool.co/api/v1/bookingportals/booking) when the component mounts. It includes headers for authorization (Bearer ${bartoken}) and project identification (projectID: "wui79ffqiics").

## Conditional Rendering

### Logged-in Check
Conditionally renders booking details if bartoken exists.

### Display Message
Shows a message to prompt the user to log in if bartoken is not present.
