# Home Component Explanation

## Overview
The `Home` component is a functional React component that demonstrates dynamic color toggling functionality based on user interaction using regular CSS.

## Imports
- **React**: Imported from React library to define React components.
- **useState**: Imported from React to manage component-level state.

## Component Structure
- **State Variables**:
  - `isRed`: Boolean state variable to track if the component is displaying in red color.
  - `isBlue`: Boolean state variable to track if the component is displaying in blue color.

- **Functions**:
  - `red()`: Toggles the `isRed` state between `true` and `false`.
  - `blue()`: Toggles the `isBlue` state between `true` and `false`.

- **Render Logic**:
  - Conditional rendering based on the values of `isRed` and `isBlue` determines whether to display a red or blue bordered circle.

- **User Interface**:
  - Two buttons (`Blue` and `Red`) trigger the `blue()` and `red()` functions respectively to change the displayed color.

## Example
```jsx
// Example of using the Home component
import React from 'react';
import Home from './Home';
import './Home.css'; // Import the custom CSS file

const HomePage = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <Home />
        </div>
    );
};
