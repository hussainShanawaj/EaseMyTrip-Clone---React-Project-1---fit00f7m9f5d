**Project Name:** Ease My Trip Clone

**Objective/Scope:**

Develop a fully functional clone of the Ease My Trip platform, focusing on seamless user experience and efficient navigation.
Implement features for flight and hotel booking, user authentication, and user-specific data management.
Provide users with the ability to search for, book, and manage flights and hotels in a responsive and intuitive interface.

**Findings/Insights:**

Ensuring a seamless user experience requires careful state management, especially when dealing with user authentication and booking data.
Dynamic content rendering based on user login status enhances user engagement and provides a personalized experience.
The importance of responsive design was highlighted, particularly in components like Navbar and booking pages, to ensure accessibility across devices.

**Skills/Tools Used:**

- Frontend Development: React.js, React Router for routing and component management.
- State Management: Context API for managing authentication states across components.
- UI Components: Material-UI for implementing responsive and consistent UI components like Modals and buttons.
- API Integration: Fetch API for handling login and data retrieval from backend services.
- Version Control: GitHub for code management and collaboration.

**Project Impact:**

Provided a comprehensive understanding of building a full-stack web application with a focus on user interaction and experience.
The project served as a practical demonstration of integrating various frontend technologies and managing state effectively across complex components.
Enhanced skills in component-based architecture, leading to cleaner code and easier maintenance.
Showcased the ability to build a clone of a popular platform, which can be a valuable addition to the developerâ€™s portfolio.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
